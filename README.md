Physical activity recognition

Problem framing, we need to distinguish between:
- moving and standing still (walking vs sitting)
  - SD will be higher for moving phases
- stable phases and moving from phase to phase (sit vs sit to stand)
  -  stable phases are longer than phase to phase
- Walking up stairs vs downstairs
  - up stairs takes longer
